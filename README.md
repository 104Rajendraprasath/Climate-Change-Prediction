🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis

This project explores climate change data using Python and Pandas.
The dataset is stored in climate_change_data.csv.
We perform data exploration, preprocessing, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

📦 Requirements

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing & feature selection)

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📝 What the Code Does

Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Displays the dataset preview (first few rows).

Shows dataset info → column names, datatypes, memory usage.

Generates descriptive statistics → mean, median, std, min, max.

Checks for missing values → helps identify columns needing cleaning.

Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → visualizes distributions, correlations, and patterns.

Performs Data Transformation → imputes missing values, scales numerical features, encodes categorical variables.

Performs Feature Selection → selects important features to reduce dimensionality and improve modeling.

🚀 Next Steps

Apply machine learning models (ANN, LSTM, GRU,RNN,Linear Regression) to predict climate risk outcomes.

Build a web application (Flask + frontend) to deploy the models.

Add visualization dashboards for trends and forecasts.

📝 Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for climate data analysis.
By cleaning and transforming the dataset and selecting the most relevant features, we can move forward to build robust predictive models for climate change risk assessment.
