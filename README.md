# Climate Change Data Analysis

This project explores climate change data using Python and Pandas. The dataset is stored in `climate_change_data.csv`. We perform **data exploration, preprocessing, and feature selection** to prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations, optional)

## What the code does
- Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Displays the dataset to preview rows.
- Shows dataset info → column names, datatypes, memory usage.
- Generates descriptive statistics → mean, median, std, min, max, etc.
- Checks for missing values → helps identify columns needing cleaning.
- Performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → visualizes distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Performs **Data Transformation** → imputes missing values, scales numerical features, encodes categorical variables.
- Performs **Feature Selection** → selects important features to reduce dimensionality and improve modeling.

## Next Steps
- Apply machine learning models to predict climate risk outcomes.

Checks for missing values → helps identify columns needing data cleaning.
